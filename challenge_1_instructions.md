## Instructions for Challenge 1 - Data wrangling

This week’s challenge is an individual coding challenge on the theme of data wrangling. Often in science and particularly in the world of data science you will be asked to review and contribute to other people’s code or to build on existing code and improve it. We have set up this week’s challenge to replicate this part of the field of data science.

This is a repository with data and a functioning `R` script. We have purposely written this code to be inefficient and a bit hard to follow. The starter script is an example of not particularly brilliant programming - though the script does currently work! Your challenge is to make the code better - more efficient, better structured, tidier, more creative and to produce and save the more finalised data outputs, including saved data objects and figures. No need to add any datasets or improving the statistical analyses, instead stick with what we have provided and focus on making the code itself better.  

This time you will work mostly independently, but each of you are being asked to provide feedback on a fellow students work and to post at least one comment on the challenge issue with your favourite dplyr/tidyverse function and a little code snippet from the challenge to show how it works. The student whose work you will provide feedback on is listed in the table below. When we are assessing your challenge, we will check out that feedback that you have provided in the other student's repository and we will check that you have incorporated the feedback that you have been given. We will also look through the issue thread to see your contribution.

__Marking criteria:__

1. Challenge: Efficiency of the modified code using the `tidyr`, `dplyr` and `ggplot` functions (the tidyverse). - 25%

2. Creativity: Creative workflow and data wrangling using a variety of `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot` or other approaches. - 25%

3. Reproducibility: Informative comments in the code and appropriate coding etiquette, good code structure with the appropriate content and order of that content, and an appropriate folder structure including a folder for the script, data and outputs of the script - the graphs and/or the data frames you’ve created, which should be saved using code. - 25%

4. Participation: Providing feedback on a fellow student's work and encorporating the feedback that you receive and participation in the Challenge Issue on GitHub in the DataScienceHub repo by including a description and code snippet of your favourite data wrangling function (using `dplyr` or another package). - 25%
